# bash scripts

We've looked at bash scripting on and off for a few meetings. The final files in this directory have been renamed a few times. Here's a quick summary of what's in each file.

| file                                       | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| bash-is-fun.sh                             | This is the original, partial bash script we built in class together on 12/16/2023.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| bash-is-fun-solved.sh                      | This is one way to finish the bash-is-fun.sh script. It is simpler than the version that I presented at our me modified it a lot since our last meeting on 12/30/2023. For example, I removed the variables that held all the messages and menu items. This will make it easier to see the text that is being used right where it is used, without having to refer back to a variable declaration section. |
| bash-is-fun-solved-better.sh               | This is a solution that shows some techniques that are potentially more robust. For example, I reintroduce variables for storing messages, and explain some reasons why this is a good idea. I also introduce bash arrays (since Henry was already looking at them) and use them to control menu options. The techniques that make this script unique are discussed in the comments at the top of the file. |
| bash-is-fun-commands-keywords-operators.md | This file has a list of the bash commands, keywords, and operators that are used in bash-is-fun-solved.sh script.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| bash-is-buggy.sh                           | This is an attempted, but buggy, solution to the original challenge as submitted by a fictitious student. Can you fix it?. Some of the bugs that are present are described in the comments at the top of the file.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| bash-is-buggy.solved                       | This is a version of bash-is-buggy.sh that has been fixed in the most direct manner I could think of.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

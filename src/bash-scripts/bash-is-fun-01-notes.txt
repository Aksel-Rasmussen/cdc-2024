-----------------      ------------------
=                      To assign values to variable names, such as `first_name="Chris"`.
basename               To get the base filename only from a file reference that might
                           include path information.
break                  To unconditionally exit (while and select) loops.

exit                   To unconditionally exit the script.
find                   To find files matching the filter supplied by the user (I did not
                           use `ls`).

select/do/done         To display simple menus
sort                   To send the data requested by the user to the `column` command.
wc                     To count vowels.
while/do/done          To create an infinite loop so the user can run the main program
                           logic repeatedly.


We'll review how I used each of these at a later meeting.

# Cedar Rapids Area Homeschools

## IT Club Cyber Defense, 2023-2024 season

This repository will hold meeting notes, source code, and anything else that seems valuable that seems like it fits better in here than in Zulip, or that we want to persist beyond Zulip's 10,000-post history.

## Resources

In addition to this GitHub site, we will be using a few other resources this year.

## Zulip

- [Zulip](https://cyberdefense.zulipchat.com) is a chat and collaboration platform. It's a lot like **Slack** (which we used last year).

  It is structured around "streams," which are like channels in other apps. However, when you start a new message in a stream, you give it a topic, and people reply to that topic.

  The benefit of this is that instead of having an unmanageable mess of unread threads, each thread is named so you can distinguish them more easily and know which threads (topics) you want to stay caught up on. You will be sent an invitation to sign up for our **Zulip** server.

- **Discord** is, um, another chat platform. While **Zulip** will be a private platform for our team only, the Discord channel will be one that is open to students from all teams.

<br/>

- [ISERINK](https://iseage2.iseage.org) is a Virtual Machine platform (running VMWare VSphere) that Iowa State makes available for teams to use. It's basically the Internet in a bottle.

- **Zoom** will be used for video conferencing. This will allow us to share our screens with each other. Also, if you are unable to attend in person, Zoom will enable you to attend remotely if you want to. The URL for the Zoom meetings will be in a calendar invitation I will send out soon.

## Contributing Guidelines

You don't need this information if you just want to read the information posted in the repository.

If you want to contribute to this repository, use the clone/PR workflow. If you need help getting started, here is one of the easiest ways to do it.

### Preparation

First things first: you need a GitHub account and the GitHub software for Windows. Let me know if you want to do this on Linux.

1. Make sure you have a GitHub account.
   * You can [sign up for one](https://github.com/signup "GitHub signup page") if you don't.
   * If you are signing up for a new account, only continue after you successfully log on to GitHub.
2. Install [GitHub Desktop for Windows](https://desktop.github.com/ "GitHub Desktop homepage"). Open it and log onto GitHub.

### Cloning the Repository

Next, you need a copy of the repository (repo) to work with. The easiest way to do this is by *cloning* the repo.

1. To start the process come back to this web page. Click the green **Code** button near the upper-right corner, and click on Open in **GitHub Desktop**.
2. This should open a dialog in GitHub Desktop. Click the **Clone** button and a clone of the repository will be copied to your computer.

### Making Changes to the Repository Locally

1. After the repo has been cloned to your computer, you are free to make any changes to it that you'd like. This is safe, because you are working with a clone of the repo, not the GitHub repo itself, and a clone is essentially just a backup.

### Sending Your Changes Back to GitHub

Once you have changes done that you want to publish in GitHub, you need to save those changes, send them back to GitHub, and then request that they be reviewed.

1. Saving your changes
   * In GitHub jargon, to permanently save your changes to your local copy of the repository, you *commit* them. When you've made your changes, you can go back to **GitHub Desktop** and it can show you side-by-side comparisons of the changes you've made.

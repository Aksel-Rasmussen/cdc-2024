            <li>We began by lamenting the fact that ISERINK was not available. Tech support on Discord was pretty responsive, but ISERINK was not available until about the time our meeting was done. Because of this, and because I couldn't figure out on the fly a good way to show everyone how to do the same exercises in a way that worked on all the platforms that everyone was running, I pretty much ran in demo mode."</li>
            <li>Next, we moved on to lamenting the fact that the interactions with my VirtualBox VM where awful. My keyboard was laggy and sometimes produced multiple keystrokes when I had tried to only press a key once. Rebooting my VirtualBox VM resolved this.</li>

## Installing `openssh-server` and `openssh-client`

I began by installing `openssh-server` and `openssh-client` on the Linux VM. Here's the short version of how to do that:

```bash
# always update your local cache of the apt catalog before using apt:
sudo apt update
sudp apt install openssh-server openssh-client
```

If this succeeds, you should the ssh client installed and have a functioning ssh server running on your VM. At this point, I demonstrated that I could connect to my localhost. Originally the hope was to have you all configure ssh servers on ISERINK and connect to each others, but we couldn't do that since ISERINK was down.

## Discovering important ssh server configuration options

At this point, I asked you to do the following two things so that we could discuss what you thought the most important ssh server settings might be

1. Find TWO pages on the web that go over best practices fo sshd configuration.
2. Pick the "five" settings you think are most important.

I did have a couple pages ready in case anyone had trouble finding pages of their own to use. Mine were the following:

* [Ubuntu&#39;s OpenSSH Documentation with Ubuntu Specifics](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/service-openssh "https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/service-openssh")
* [Simeon On Security: Effortless Security: Mastering Secure SSHD Configurations](https://simeononsecurity.com/guides/secure-sshd-configurations-guide "https://simeononsecurity.com/guides/secure-sshd-configurations-guide")
* [SSH Academy: How to Configure the OpenSSH Server?](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/sshd_config "https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/sshd_config")

I would add this page, which is from [OpenSSH](https://openssh.com) themselves: [the sshd_config file man page](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config). The default config file, placed at `/etc/sshd/sshd_config`, has lots of options present but commented out. This makes it easy to find an option if you already know it exists so you have some idea of what it will be called. The man page for this file, however, is authoritative, so if you want to learn what can be done via `sshd_config`, that's the documentation to read through.

### Your top 5(ish) ssh server configuration settings

Most of you shared with the team what you thought some of the most important configuration settings might be for an ssh server.

#### Tristan

- disable root user login (login as admin account)
- disable password login and (enable public key login or use tcp wrappers)
- ignore rhosts
- use port knocking
- specify one address to listen to rather than all and change the port

#### Henry

1. changing default port number
2. disable password authentication and use public key
3. don't allow root login and/or allow only certain users to login
4. limit the number of login attempts

#### Michael

- Reject connections to accounts with no passwords
- Use ssh keys instead of passwords
- Disable root logins
- Set a limit for password attempts
  comment: security tools can find SSH even if it's not running on port 22

#### Aksel:

- Disable root ssh
- Changing the port
- Not using passwords to login
- Changing the number of login attempts
- Disconnecting unauthenticated users (login grace time)

## The most common settings mentioned

These are the most common settings that were mentioned above, and the number of people who included that item on their lists above.

| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| disable root login                                 | all 4 people who provided input |                                                                                |

| use key pairs or certificates instead of passwords | 3 people                        |                                                                                |

| limit the number of logon attempts                 | 3 people                        |                                                                                |
| tell `sshd` to listen on specific ip address(es) | 2 people                        | only 1 of you mentioned this, but Chris voted for it so it would make the list |

## How to set these options

We looked at the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file on my VM, and it was pretty easy to configure five of the six settings above. We did not set up authentication with RSA keypairs because that topic will take a bit of time, so we'll take that on next week. Here's a quick overview of how we set each of them:

| goal                                               | `sshd_config` setting               | notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| disable root login                                 | `PermitRootLogin no`                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| disable password authentication                    | `PasswordAuthentication yes`        | We did not set this to `no` because we had not configured key pair or certificate authentication yet.                                                                                                                              |
| use key paris or certificates instead of passwords | `PubkeyAuthentication yes`          | This might be the default setting. There are several other settings to use for certificate-based authentication, but this is the only one that matters for authentication using public/private key pairs to work.                    |
| changing the port                                  | `Port<port number>`                 | The point was raised that a good scanner like `nmap` will quickly find `sshd`, no matter what port it listens on. Because of this, we did not implement this suggestion, but this is the setting you would use if you wanted to. |
| limit the number of login attempts                 | `MaxAuthTries 3`                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| tell `sshd` to listen on specific ip address(es)   | `ListenAddress 10.0.12.16,44,7.4.4` | This can be a single IP address or a comma-deliminted list of IP addresses.

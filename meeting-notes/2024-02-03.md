## Housekeeping

We had a discussion about how many hours a week you think you might be able to do homework for our club. This is just your best estimate, not a commitment, and we know that your availability may change from week to week.

| Student |    Hours Per Week    |
| ------- | :-------------------: |
| Michael |           3           |
| Henry   |        3 to 5        |
| Aksel   |        2 to 4        |
| Josh    |        2 to 3        |
| Tristan | has good availability |

This is very good information for me. Thanks for sharing this, and thanks, Dan for leading the discussion!

## Single-user mode

### Overview

Single-user mode (also called maintenance mode) is an **systemd target** called `recovery.target`. Most, but not all, Linux distributions use **systemd** as their _init_ system. **systemd** works by starting various *targets*, each of which formally declare any dependencies they have on other targets, so that you only have to tell **systemd** to start the target you're interested in, and the dependencies will be started first, automatically.

### Starting single-user mode

If you start the `recovery.target`, you will be placed in a terminal shell as root. This can be useful in many situations. Here are some:

- Accessing a Linux computer you've become locked out of
- Repairing damage caused by malicious actors
- Applying patches that require the system to be offline
- Fixing filesystem errors or recovering corrupt files
- Diagnosing system crashes
- Recovering from a system crash or failed boot

To enter single-user mode you follow a procedure similar to the following. You may need to consult a web search engine or your system documentation, depending on your exact hardware, operating system, and boot manager.

1. Reboot the computer
2. During reboot, *do something* to get to boot manager menu

- In Ubuntu, the boot manager is usually GRUB
- For GRUB, you can access the menu in one of the following ways.

  - Your GRUB configuration may be set to show the GRUB menu each time your computer reboots. If this is the case, just wait for the menu to appear.
  - Tap the ESC key immediately after seeing the computer's reboot splash screen, before the OS begins posting reboot log messages. This is said to work for UEFI-managed devices.
  - Hold down the SHIFT key while rebooting. This is said to work for BIOS-managed devices.

3. Once you are in the GRUB menu, ensure that the OS you want to boot is selected and tap the 'e' key.

- If you don't know which line to select, choose the one with the asterisk (*) next to the OS name. That is the OS that boots by default.

4. Now you should be in a simple text editor.

- Find the line that mentions `vmlinuz`
- Add 'single' to the end of that line
- Tap F10 to boot into single-user mode

5. At this point, Linux should boot into single-user mode and drop you into a shell as the root user. You may now do whatever maintenance or recovery tasks you need to do.
6. When you are finished, type 'exit' to continue into your normal boot target.

## How can we secure single-user mode?

As we've seen, single-user mode can be accessed by anyone who has access to a physical or virtual console on a Linux computer, and it drops the user into a root shell. Because of this, physical or virtual access to a computer's console is a highly privileged operation and should be tightly controlled. How can we protect bad actors from accessing single-user mode on computers - and especially from accessing it on our VMs on ISEAGE during competition?

You had several ideas about this.

- Protect against grub reboot
- Disable recovery in grub
  - Bad actors could still mount the drive in another OS
  - We can encrypt the volumes to prevent this

## Installing and configuring ssh server

Installing ssh server is not difficult in Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server openssh-client
```

After doing this, the only active directives (ones that are not commented out) in your brand-new `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file will be the following:

```config
KbdInteractiveAuthentication no
UsePAM yes
X11Forwarding yes
PrintMotd no
AcceptEnv LANG LC_*
Subsystem	sftp	/usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server
```

Last week, we talked about the settings we would like to change, and the only ones we have changed so far are the following. Obviously, the exact values used on each server
may different.

```config
ListenAddress 192.168.2.240
PermitRootLogin no
MaxAuthTries 4
# We didn't discuss this, but we don't need
# to support running graphical apps over ssh:
X11Forwarding no
```

The other defaults were pretty sane!

## Authenticating to SSH using RSA keys

It is easy to set up SSH to use public/private key pairs for authentication instead of passwords. This has some security benefits:

- There are no passwords to remember.
- There are no passwords to type wrong three times and get locked out.
- There are no passwords to be stolen.
- The same key can be used securely on multiple servers.
- If you use only keys (or certificates) to access servers, and then use sudo with passwords, the user won't be able to sudo to root.
  - They wont' be able to change their password to a known value because a non-root user must know their current password in order to change it.

### How to set up SSH to use RSA keys

#### Generate an RSA keypair using `ssh-keygen`

There are many variables you can use with this command, but just running it on its own will make reasonably sane decisions about how to generate a keypair for you. The interaction will look something like this.

```bash
bobby@palo:~$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/bobby/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/bobby/.ssh/id_rsa
Your public key has been saved in /home/bobby/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:mfDDizcZ148lgxEuJtn54/yswN/wPu3bL1CXw10d+NU bobby@palo
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
|          .   ..+|
|       o o . .  E|
|      + = o   o =|
|       * = +  .=o|
|        S = +....|
|       o O ..*   |
|      . B + .o.  |
|       . + *. o. |
|          oo*ooo+|
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

After running `ssh-keygen`, you will have two files, a public key and a private key. Here, I left the prompt at its default value, so the files will be `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. You can give any base name for the file, but you will want to keep it in `~/.ssh`.

If you add a passphrase, then you will be prompted for it whenever you use the keypair for any purpose. If not, you (or anyone else who comes into possession of the keypair) can simply use it at will.

> Notice that after creating these notes, I deleted this key because I'm not comfortable using keys if other people have the output listed above. I don't know if it matters for other people to have that randomart image or not.

To use the keys, do the following.

1. In your home directory on the SSH server, open the file `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`. Create it if it doesn't exist yet. Paste in the contents of your public key (the `*.pub` file) at the bottom of this file, as a brand-new line.

- The content of the `*.pub` file will be one long line, but it will be only one line. If it looks like it's multiple lines, that should just be because word wrap is on. Don't add any line breaks.

2. Make sure that the all of the key files in your home directory, on both the SSH server and on your SSH client, are only accessible by your account. If you use `ls -l` to view the file, the mode should have `---` for "world," and preferably for "group" also. Example:

```bash
bobby@palo:~$ ll ./.ssh
total 20
drwx------ 2 bobby bobby 4096 Feb  8 00:08 ./
drwxr-x--- 5 bobby bobby 4096 Feb  7 23:40 ../
-r-------- 1 bobby bobby  568 Feb  7 23:05 authorized_keys
-r-------- 1 bobby bobby 2590 Feb  8 00:08 id_rsa
-r-------- 1 bobby bobby  564 Feb  8 00:08 id_rsa.pub
-rw------- 1 bobby bobby    0 Feb  7 23:21 known_hosts
```

> Note: you'll want `known_hosts` to be writeable by your account so that `ssh` can update this file whenever you say that you trust a new server signature.

3. Double-check everything:

- On the server, you should have:
  - Permissions locked down on the files in `~/.ssh`, as explained above.
  - Your public key in a single line inside `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
    - If it takes more than one line, it's not a valid public key.
    - If it says `BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY` on the first line or `END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY` on the last line, it's not a valid public key.
    - Never give your private key away to anyone for any reason. Keep a copy of it in your password vault.
- On the client, you should have:
  - Permissions locked down on the files in `~/.ssh`, as explained above.
  - Both the public key and private key in `~/.ssh`.

4. Profit. At this point, you should be able to connect from the SSH client to the SSH server using only your key files to prove your identity.

## Homework

### Basic Homework for Everyone (Frogger Level)

Please log onto ISERINK and do the following:

1. Install SSH server and client on a VM.
2. Make the configuration changes described in the section [Installing and configuring ssh server](#installing-and-configuring-ssh-server).

- If you have a `144.76.90.0/24` address that is working, use that as your `ListenAddress` in `sshd_config`.
- If not, use `127.0.0.1` (which is one of the loopback addresses).
  - If you use this address, you will be able to connect to your SSH server from your SSH server but not from anywhere else.

3. Ensure that you can logon using password authentication.

### Intermediate Homework (Padawan Level)

Follow the section [How to set up SSH to use RSA keys](#how-to-set-up-ssh-to-use-rsa-keys) above and see if you can get authentication by RSA keypairs working.

### Advanced Homework (Leroy Jenkins Level)

If you've made it this far, pick either of these topics and let us know what you find by posting an article in Zulip, or posting a PR to our GitHub repo. If you find something you think would be helpful for competition, ask for a few minutes to do a demo.

#### Securing single-user mode

One idea about how to protect a drive volume involved encrypting the volume. At competition, we might just see if we can password-protect the boot process using BIOS/UEFI setup, but this would also be interesting to look into.

- Research LUKS and find out what it can and can't do to help us secure a drive volume. 
  - Can it be installed on an existing OS?
  - Can it protect an entire OS?
  - Are there good alternatives?

Basically, this is an open-ended invitation to learn whatever you can about protecting single-user mode from a bad actor who gains access to a terminal.

#### SSH

[This page](https://goteleport.com/blog/how-to-ssh-properly/) has a lot of really good information on configuring SSH security "properly." Two things the article discuss that are pretty interesting are these:

- Using certificates instead of public/private keypairs
- Integrating Google Authenticator with SSH Authentication

I will probably demonstrate Google Authenticator briefly during our meeting Saturday, but if you want to learn something different about SSH, these look like interesting topics. The whole article has good information. As with the previous topic, consider this an invitation to use this as a starting point to learn whatever you think are the most important things to know.

# Lola, the name for good books.

Lola is a name created by authors to make their books more interesting.
This tecnuique "Just add Lola." (abbreviated to JaL) can be used to increase audience retention in nearly any form of media.
This includes videos, podcasts, books, movies, TV shows, websites and many more.
That's very important to everyone who wants to make a good and entertaining piece of media.
I just hope that you can gain a little from this article.
